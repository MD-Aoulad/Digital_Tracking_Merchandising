# üöÄ LAUNCH PLAN - Workforce Management Platform

## 1. **Morning: Environment Stabilization & Backend Hardening**
- [ ] **Kill all processes on port 5000 and 3000**
  - `lsof -i :5000` and `kill -9 <PID>`
  - `lsof -i :3000` and `kill -9 <PID>`
- [ ] **Check for zombie Node.js processes**
  - `ps aux | grep node` and kill any stuck processes
- [ ] **Clear backend logs**
  - `rm -f logs/backend.log`
- [ ] **Restart backend with memory monitoring**
  - `cd backend && npm start`
  - In a new terminal: `tail -f ../logs/backend.log`
  - If you see "Killed: 9" or OOM, reduce seed data or increase swap: `sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1m count=2048 && sudo mkswap /swapfile && sudo swapon /swapfile`
- [ ] **Restart frontend**
  - `cd .. && npm start`
- [ ] **Verify both servers are running**
  - Visit `http://localhost:3000` and `http://localhost:5000/api/test`
  - If backend fails, fix before proceeding!

## 2. **Late Morning: Critical Path & Error-Proofing**
- [ ] **Test login/logout with real and demo users**
  - Use `admin@company.com` / `password` and `richard@company.com` / `password`
- [ ] **Test dashboard, todo, and all protected routes**
- [ ] **If blank page, check browser console and backend logs**
  - Add error boundaries to `src/App.tsx` and key pages to show user-friendly errors
  - Ensure login page always renders, even if backend is down (show clear error if API unreachable)
- [ ] **Add fallback UI for backend/API errors**
  - Show a message like "Server temporarily unavailable. Please try again later."
- [ ] **Test on a second device/network if possible**

## 3. **Afternoon: Feature Smoke Test & Demo Prep**
- [ ] **Test all major features:**
  - Todo creation, assignment, completion
  - User management
  - Reports, approvals, chat, etc.
- [ ] **Fix any showstopper bugs**
- [ ] **Document any non-blocking issues**
- [ ] **Prepare demo user accounts**
  - Ensure at least one admin and one employee account work
- [ ] **Create a demo script/checklist**
  - List the exact steps you will show the client (see below)

## 4. **Evening: Launch & Demo Readiness**
- [ ] **Run all automated tests**
  - `npm test` or `./scripts/run-all-tests.sh`
- [ ] **Generate and review test/coverage reports**
- [ ] **Prepare a ‚ÄúKnown Issues‚Äù section for users**
- [ ] **Write a ‚ÄúHow to Start‚Äù section for the team**
- [ ] **Backup and tag the codebase**
  - `git tag pre-launch-$(date +%Y%m%d)`

## 5. **Night: Final Checklist**
- [ ] **All servers running and stable (no OOM, no port conflicts)**
- [ ] **All critical flows tested (login, todo, dashboard, logout)**
- [ ] **No blank pages or silent failures**
- [ ] **Demo script printed or on a second screen**
- [ ] **Send launch/demo instructions to the team**

---

## üö¶ **If Blocked:**
- If backend keeps dying, move to a smaller dataset, increase swap, or restart your machine.
- If frontend is blank, check browser console and add error boundaries/logging.
- If auth is blocking feature work, temporarily bypass auth for dev (never for client demo).

---

## üì¢ **Communication**
- Post regular updates in team chat.
- Escalate any showstopper issues immediately.

---

# üé¨ **How to Demo to Clients (No Surprises!)**

## **Before the Demo:**
- [ ] **Start backend and frontend at least 30 minutes before the meeting**
- [ ] **Log in as admin and employee in two browser tabs**
- [ ] **Pre-create a few todos, users, and reports for demo**
- [ ] **Open all key pages in advance (dashboard, todo, reports, etc.)**
- [ ] **Have a backup browser/device ready**

## **During the Demo:**
1. **Login as Admin**
   - Show dashboard, todo list, and admin features
2. **Switch to Employee**
   - Show assigned todos, limited permissions
3. **Create a Todo**
   - Assign to employee, show real-time update
4. **Show Error Handling**
   - (Optional) Simulate backend down, show friendly error message
5. **Logout and Re-login**
   - Prove that login/logout is stable
6. **Q&A**
   - Be ready to answer questions about stability, security, and scalability

## **After the Demo:**
- [ ] **Leave the app running for client review**
- [ ] **Send follow-up email with demo accounts and instructions**

---

**Goal:** LAUNCH TOMORROW with a stable, working app, zero backend/login issues, and a smooth, professional client demo.
