# Accessibility Fixes for Mobile App

## Issue Description

The mobile app was experiencing accessibility warnings related to `aria-hidden` attributes:

```
Blocked aria-hidden on an element because its descendant retained focus. 
The focus must not be hidden from assistive technology users.
```

This warning occurs when an element with `aria-hidden="true"` contains a focused element, which violates accessibility guidelines.

## Root Cause

The issue was caused by React Native's internal components and the Expo development environment automatically adding `aria-hidden` attributes to certain DOM elements, while focusable elements (buttons, inputs, etc.) remained inside these containers.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. FocusManager Component

Created a `FocusManager` component (`src/components/FocusManager.tsx`) that:
- Monitors focus events on web platform
- Automatically removes `aria-hidden` attributes from elements containing focusable children
- Ensures proper focus management during navigation

### 2. Accessibility Utilities

Created accessibility utilities (`src/utils/accessibility.ts`) that provide:
- `ensureProperFocus()`: Ensures proper focus management
- `cleanupAriaHidden()`: Removes problematic aria-hidden attributes
- `setupAccessibilityListeners()`: Sets up event listeners for accessibility
- `getAccessibilityProps()`: Helper for adding accessibility props to components

### 3. App-Level Integration

Updated `App.tsx` to:
- Wrap the entire app with `FocusManager`
- Add proper accessibility attributes to the root container
- Handle focus management during navigation state changes

## Usage

The accessibility fixes are automatically applied when the app runs. No additional configuration is required.

### For Developers

If you encounter similar accessibility issues in new components:

1. **Use the accessibility utilities:**
```typescript
import { getAccessibilityProps } from '../utils/accessibility';

// In your component
<TouchableOpacity {...getAccessibilityProps('Button Label', 'button')}>
  Button Text
</TouchableOpacity>
```

2. **Wrap problematic areas with FocusManager:**
```typescript
import FocusManager from '../components/FocusManager';

<FocusManager>
  {/* Your component content */}
</FocusManager>
```

3. **Add proper accessibility attributes:**
```typescript
<View 
  accessible={true}
  accessibilityRole="none"
  accessibilityLabel="Descriptive label"
>
  {/* Content */}
</View>
```

## Testing

To verify the fixes work:

1. Run the app in web mode: `npx expo start --web`
2. Open browser developer tools
3. Check the console for accessibility warnings
4. Navigate between screens and interact with components
5. Verify no `aria-hidden` warnings appear

## Browser Compatibility

These fixes are specifically designed for web platforms (when running React Native in web mode). On native platforms (iOS/Android), these utilities are no-ops and don't affect performance.

## Performance Impact

- Minimal performance impact on web platforms
- No impact on native platforms
- Periodic cleanup runs every 1 second to prevent issues
- Event listeners are properly cleaned up on component unmount

## Future Considerations

- Monitor for new accessibility issues as the app grows
- Consider adding automated accessibility testing
- Keep accessibility utilities updated with React Native changes
- Test with screen readers and other assistive technologies
