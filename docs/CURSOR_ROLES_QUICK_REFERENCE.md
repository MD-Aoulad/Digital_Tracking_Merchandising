## üö® **Critical Rules (NO EXCEPTIONS)**

### **‚úÖ Always Do These**
- ‚úÖ Use designated roles for specific tasks
- ‚úÖ Work in Docker containers only
- ‚úÖ Use designated ports (3000, 8080, 3012, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Pull latest changes before starting work
- ‚úÖ Test on both platforms before deployment
- ‚úÖ Follow UI immutability rules

### **‚ùå Never Do These**
- ‚ùå Develop outside Docker containers
- ‚ùå Use random ports
- ‚ùå Modify existing UI components
- ‚ùå Work on outdated code
- ‚ùå Assume cross-platform compatibility
- ‚ùå Skip role-specific testing

## üõ†Ô∏è **Essential Scripts**

### **Port Management**
```bash
./scripts/check-ports.sh          # Check all ports
./scripts/port-killer.sh 3000     # Kill process on port
```

### **Memory Management (Mac 8GB)**
```bash
./scripts/mac-memory-optimizer.sh start    # Start lightweight mode
./scripts/mac-memory-optimizer.sh monitor  # Monitor memory usage
./scripts/mac-memory-optimizer.sh cleanup  # Cleanup resources
```

### **Docker Management**
```bash
./scripts/docker-service-manager.sh start    # Start all services
./scripts/docker-service-manager.sh status   # Check status
./scripts/docker-service-manager.sh stop     # Stop all services
./scripts/docker-service-manager.sh restart  # Restart services
```

### **Compliance & Testing**
```bash
./scripts/ui-compliance-checker.sh           # UI compliance check
./scripts/cross-platform-verifier.sh         # Cross-platform test
./scripts/platform-health-check.sh           # Platform health
```

---

## üö® **Troubleshooting**

### **Port Conflicts**
```bash
# Find what's using the port
lsof -i :3000

# Kill the process
./scripts/port-killer.sh 3000

# Verify port is free
lsof -i :3000
```

### **Docker Issues**
```bash
# Check Docker status
docker info

# Restart Docker services
./scripts/docker-service-manager.sh restart

# Clean up Docker resources
./scripts/docker-service-manager.sh clean
```

### **Cross-Platform Issues**
```bash
# Platform-specific troubleshooting
./scripts/mac-memory-optimizer.sh
./scripts/windows-troubleshooter.sh

# Cross-platform verification
./scripts/cross-platform-verifier.sh
```
