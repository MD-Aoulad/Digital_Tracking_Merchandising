# UI Layout Reference

This folder contains screenshots of all major features and pages in the application. Use these images as a reference for UI consistency, design reviews, and to communicate UI expectations for future development.

## How to Use
- Add a screenshot for each major feature or page (e.g., Login, Dashboard, Todo, Reports, etc.).
- Name each file clearly (e.g., login.png, dashboard.png, todo-list.png).
- Update this README with a list of included screenshots and their descriptions.

## Example Structure
- login.png — Login page layout
- dashboard.png — Main dashboard view
- todo-list.png — Todo management screen
- report-detail.png — Report details view

## Why?
- Ensures UI changes are intentional and reviewed
- Helps new team members understand the expected look and feel
- Provides a visual baseline for QA and design
