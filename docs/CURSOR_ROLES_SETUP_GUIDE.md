## üö® **Critical Cross-Platform Rules**

### **‚úÖ Always Follow These Standards**

#### **1. üê≥ Docker-First Development**
```bash
# ‚úÖ CORRECT: Always work in Docker containers
docker-compose exec service-name bash

# ‚ùå WRONG: Never develop directly on host
npm start  # Don't do this
```

#### **2. üîå Port Management**
```bash
# ‚úÖ CORRECT: Use designated ports only
Frontend: 3000, API Gateway: 8080, Chat: 3012

# ‚ùå WRONG: Never use random ports
Frontend: 3001, API Gateway: 8081  # Don't do this
```

#### **3. üé® UI Immutability**
```bash
# ‚úÖ CORRECT: Add new features without changing existing UI
# ‚ùå WRONG: Never modify existing components
```

#### **4. üîÑ Git Synchronization**
```bash
# ‚úÖ CORRECT: Always pull before starting work
git pull origin main

# ‚ùå WRONG: Never work on outdated code
```

#### **5. üõ°Ô∏è Cross-Platform Compatibility**
```bash
# ‚úÖ CORRECT: Test on both platforms
./scripts/cross-platform-test.sh

# ‚ùå WRONG: Assume it works on both platforms
```

./scripts/docker-service-manager.sh start --mac
./scripts/docker-service-manager.sh start --windows
```

#### **3. File Path Issues**
```bash
# Problem: Different file path conventions
# Solution: Use Docker volumes and relative paths
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
```

#### **4. Memory Issues (8GB Mac)**
```bash
# Problem: Mac runs out of memory with full stack
# Solution: Use lightweight mode
./scripts/mac-memory-optimizer.sh start
./scripts/mac-memory-optimizer.sh monitor
./scripts/mac-memory-optimizer.sh cleanup
```

#### **5. Performance Differences**
