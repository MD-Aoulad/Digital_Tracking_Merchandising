## 🚨 **MANDATORY DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS**

### **CRITICAL: ALL AGENTS MUST FOLLOW THESE STANDARDS**

Before starting ANY work, ALL agents MUST:

1. **Read the Development Standards**: `docs/AGENT_DEVELOPMENT_STANDARDS.md`
2. **Follow the Enforcement Guide**: `docs/AGENT_ENFORCEMENT_GUIDE.md`
3. **Use the Provided Scripts**: All scripts in `scripts/` directory
4. **Check Port Availability**: Always run `./scripts/check-ports.sh` first
5. **Verify UI Compliance**: Run `./scripts/ui-compliance-checker.sh` before commits
6. **Work in Docker**: Never develop outside Docker containers
7. **Maintain Tech Stack**: Never suggest or implement new technologies

### **Key Rules (NO EXCEPTIONS)**
- **UI IMMUTABILITY**: Never change existing UI components
- **PORT MANAGEMENT**: Always use designated ports, never jump to others
- **TECH STACK**: Never change the established technology stack
- **DOCKER FIRST**: Always develop within Docker microservices

### **Required Scripts for Every Agent**
```bash
# Before starting work
./scripts/check-ports.sh
./scripts/network-architecture-enforcer.sh validate
./scripts/docker-service-manager.sh start

# Before committing
./scripts/ui-compliance-checker.sh
./scripts/check-ports.sh
./scripts/network-architecture-enforcer.sh validate

# For troubleshooting
./scripts/port-killer.sh <port_number>
./scripts/docker-service-manager.sh status
./scripts/network-architecture-enforcer.sh fix
```

**Remember**: Each agent has 10-15 years of experience and deep expertise in their domain. The Product Owner brings 10 years of retail operations experience to ensure all solutions align with real-world business needs and user requirements. The UI/UX Expert and JavaScript/Animation Expert bring 15 years of experience in creating exceptional user experiences with smooth animations and optimal performance. Always consider the impact on retail operations and maintain focus on delivering value to merchandising professionals.

**CRITICAL**: Violation of these standards will result in immediate reversion and documentation of the violation. The goal is to maintain a stable, consistent, and reliable development environment with exceptional user experience and performance.
