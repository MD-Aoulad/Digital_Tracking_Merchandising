# Free Tier Strategies - Stay Free Longer!

This guide helps you maximize your free tier usage and understand what happens when you exceed limits.

## ðŸš¨ What Happens When You Exceed Free Limits

### **GitHub Actions (CI/CD)**
- **Free**: 2000 minutes/month (public repos) or 500 minutes/month (private repos)
- **When exceeded**: Builds will fail with "minutes exceeded" error
- **Impact**: No new deployments until next month
- **Solution**: Wait until next month OR upgrade to GitHub Pro ($4/month)

### **Vercel (Frontend)**
- **Free**: 100GB bandwidth/month
- **When exceeded**: Site goes down temporarily
- **Impact**: Users can't access your app
- **Solution**: Upgrade to Vercel Pro ($20/month) for unlimited bandwidth

### **Render (Backend)**
- **Free**: 750 hours/month
- **When exceeded**: Service goes to sleep (takes 30 seconds to wake up)
- **Impact**: First request after inactivity is slow
- **Solution**: Upgrade to Render Paid ($7/month) for always-on service

### **Supabase (Database)**
- **Free**: 500MB storage, 50MB file storage
- **When exceeded**: Database becomes read-only
- **Impact**: Can't save new data
- **Solution**: Upgrade to Supabase Pro ($25/month) for more storage

## ðŸ’¡ **Smart Strategies to Stay Free Longer**

### **GitHub Actions Optimization**

#### Reduce Build Time
```yaml
# In .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml
- name: Cache dependencies
  uses: actions/cache@v3
  with:
    path: |
      node_modules
      */*/node_modules
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
```

#### Only Run Tests When Needed
```yaml
# Only run on main and develop branches
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
```

#### Skip Tests for Documentation
```yaml
# Skip CI for documentation changes
- name: Skip CI for docs
  if: contains(github.event.head_commit.message, '[skip ci]')
  run: exit 0
```

### **Vercel Optimization**

#### Image Optimization
```javascript
// Use Next.js Image component or optimize images
import Image from 'next/image'

// Compress images to WebP format
// Use appropriate sizes
```

#### Enable Compression
```javascript
// In next.config.js
module.exports = {
  compress: true,
  poweredByHeader: false,
}
```

#### Static Asset Optimization
```bash
# Use CDN for static assets
# Compress CSS and JS files
# Enable gzip compression
```

### **Render Optimization**

#### Use Sleep Mode Wisely
```javascript
// In your backend, add health check endpoint
app.get('/health', (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).json({ status: 'ok' });
});
```

#### Efficient Database Queries
```javascript
// Use indexes for frequently queried columns
// Limit query results
// Use pagination
```

### **Supabase Optimization**

#### Clean Up Old Data
```sql
-- Archive old records
INSERT INTO archived_todos 
SELECT * FROM todos 
WHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '6 months';

-- Delete archived records
DELETE FROM todos 
WHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '6 months';
```

#### Use Efficient Queries
```sql
-- Add indexes for frequently queried columns
CREATE INDEX idx_todos_user_id ON todos(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_todos_created_at ON todos(created_at);

-- Use pagination
SELECT * FROM todos 
WHERE user_id = $1 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 20 OFFSET 0;
```

## ðŸ“Š **Monitoring Your Usage**

### **GitHub Actions**
```bash
# Check usage in GitHub
# Go to: https://github.com/settings/billing
# Look for "Actions" section
```

### **Vercel**
```bash
# Check bandwidth usage
vercel usage

# Or check dashboard: https://vercel.com/dashboard
```

### **Render**
```bash
# Check hours usage
# Go to: https://dashboard.render.com
# Look at service details
```

### **Supabase**
```bash
# Check storage usage
# Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
# Look at project settings
```

## ðŸš€ **When to Upgrade (Priority Order)**

### **Priority 1: Critical (Upgrade Immediately)**
- **Vercel**: If your site goes down due to bandwidth
- **Render**: If service sleeps too often and affects users
- **Cost**: $27/month

### **Priority 2: Important (Upgrade When You Have Users)**
- **Supabase**: If database becomes read-only
- **GitHub Pro**: If builds fail due to minutes
- **Cost**: $29/month additional

### **Priority 3: Nice to Have (Upgrade When Profitable)**
- **Custom Domain**: $10-15/year
- **Monitoring**: $15-50/month
- **Support**: $20-100/month

## ðŸ’° **Cost Progression Strategy**

### **Phase 1: MVP (Months 1-3)**
- **Cost**: $0/month
- **Focus**: Build and test
- **Limits**: Stay within free tiers

### **Phase 2: Early Users (Months 4-6)**
- **Cost**: $27/month (Vercel Pro + Render Paid)
- **Focus**: User acquisition
- **Limits**: Handle 1000+ users

### **Phase 3: Growth (Months 7-12)**
- **Cost**: $56/month (Add Supabase Pro + GitHub Pro)
- **Focus**: Scale and optimize
- **Limits**: Handle 10,000+ users

### **Phase 4: Scale (Year 2+)**
- **Cost**: $100-200/month
- **Focus**: Enterprise features
- **Limits**: Handle 100,000+ users

## ðŸ”§ **Free Tier Monitoring Script**

Create a script to monitor usage:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# monitor-usage.sh

echo "ðŸ“Š Free Tier Usage Monitor"
echo "=========================="

# Check GitHub Actions
echo "GitHub Actions: Check https://github.com/settings/billing"

# Check Vercel
echo "Vercel: Run 'vercel usage' or check dashboard"

# Check Render
echo "Render: Check https://dashboard.render.com"

# Check Supabase
echo "Supabase: Check https://supabase.com/dashboard"

echo ""
echo "ðŸ’¡ Tips:"
echo "- Monitor usage weekly"
echo "- Optimize before upgrading"
echo "- Only upgrade when necessary"
```
